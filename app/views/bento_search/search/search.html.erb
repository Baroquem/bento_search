<%# sorry, we'd rather put this logic in the controller, but there's
    no way to call a template-with-yield (aka partial layout) from controller,
    grr. Could do it from a helper, but we want to minimize helpers that
    pollute app's helper space. %>
<% if @partial_wrapper %>
  <%=   
      render :layout => @partial_wrapper, :locals => {:results => @results} do 
      
        bento_search(@results)
  
      end
  -%>
<% else %>
  <%=   bento_search(@results) %>
<% end %>
